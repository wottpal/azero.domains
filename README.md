# azero.domains â€“ Domain Nameservice for Aleph Zero

This is a hackathon project built at ETHWarsaw by [@dennis_zoma](https://twitter.com/dennis_zoma), [@mike1third](https://twitter.com/mike1third), [@cryptoneur_eth](https://twitter.com/cryptoneur_eth), and [@atris_eth](https://twitter.com/atris_eth).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install pnpm
npm i -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy & fill environments
cp packages/frontend/.env.local.example packages/frontend/.env.local
# cp packages/contracts/.env.example packages/contracts/.env
```

## Development

I reommend developing in VSCode by opening the workspace file located at `.vscode/azns.code-workspace` and installing recommended plugins listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

```bash
# Generate contract-types, start local hardhat node, and start frontend with turborepo
pnpm dev

# Only start frontend
pnpm frontend:dev
```
